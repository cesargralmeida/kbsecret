=========================================================

## SYNOPSIS

`kbsecret commands` [options]

"kbsecret-do-magic".

By default, all commands (internal and external) are printed.

## OPTIONS

    Print only external commands, i.e. those on your *$PATH*.

* `-i`, `--internal-only`:
    Print only internal commands, i.e. those bundled with kbsecret(1).
