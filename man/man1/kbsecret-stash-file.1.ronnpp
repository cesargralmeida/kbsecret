kbsecret-stash-file(1) - store a file in a kbsecret(1) record
==========================================================

## SYNOPSIS

`kbsecret stash-file` [options] <record> ![filename]

## DESCRIPTION

`kbsecret stash-file` stores the contents of a given file in an unstructured record.

If "-" is passed instead of *filename*, then standard input is read instead.

## OPTIONS

* `-s`, `--session` <session>:
  The session to create the record under.

  If unspecified, the *default* session is assumed.

* `-f`, `--force`:
  Force record creation, even if overwriting another record with the same label.

* `-b`, `--base64`:
  Base64 encode the file before stashing it. This is useful primarily for stashing
  binary files, as records cannot currently contain binary data.

* `-`, `--stdin`:
  Read the file from standard input instead of from *filename*.

## EXAMPLES

```
  $ kbsecret stash-file priv-key ~/privkey.gpg

  $ kbsecret stash-file note-to-self -
  the secret password is '1234'
```
